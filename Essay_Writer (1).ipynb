In the late 18th century, when the Constitution was written, times were different; there was a need for disciplined, well armed soldiers to maintain the safety of the society. Contemporarily the police department preserves the safety of society and the need for soldiers to enforce the law is out of date. Time will tell if the new laws are necessary.\n",
            "In the U.S. there are approximately 200 million privately owned guns, which is statistically close to a gun per person and places more than one gun per home on average (Ibid). In other words, guns are all around. This effects, without a doubt, the whole society structure and the citizens that live within its boundaries.\n",
            "The children that live within a gun infested society are going to suffer the consequences. In fact, kids between the ages 16 and 19 have the highest handgun victimization rate among all age groups (O’Donnell 771). It’s not hard to understand why, since there are on average more than one gun per household, kids are likely to find firearm and in some cases even use it.\n",
            "In March 1998 two children, 11 and 13 years of age gunned down a total of 13 people in a school in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Of the 13, nine survived and five people, classmates and teacher, died as a result of the shooting (Liesen, Owens). One of the boys had taken two rifles from his grandfather. They positioned themselves about a 100 yards from the schoolyard and when the bell for recession sounded and people started to exit the school building the two boys opened fire. This is a horrendous event that proves that if guns are present within a household or within a family, odds are that kids will know about where they are kept and perhaps even be curious enough to actually use them.\n",
            "In October, 1997 a 16 year old boy shot and killed his girlfriend and her best friend while they were exiting a Mississippi school leaving six others wounded (Liesen, Owens). The spontaneity of young children and guns are a lethal combination as illustrated in these two examples.\n",
            "In a study made across high schools in Seattle, 47% of males and 22% of females reported that they had easy access to handguns and 11.4% were gun-owning males (O’Donnell 772). The access to guns might prove to be a deadly for both innocent bystanders and the holder of the gun. Children should not be able to own guns. One of the prerequisites for owning a gun should be that the person is responsible enough to own a firearm. Since there are no guarantees for that, guns should only be issued in extensively controlled forms otherwise the government jeopardizes the safety of the people they've sworn to protect.\n",
            "In ages 10-14 72%, and in the ages 15-19, 85% of all homicides are committed with firearms. In addition to that 60 % of all suicides among youths is committed with a handgun. The total firearm death rate concerning white males in their teens now exceed natural causes (O’Donnell 771). These are alarming statistics show the brutal reality of firearms in the U.S. \n",
            "A study made by the American Psychological Association, Commission on Violence and Youth showed, in a study made in Seattle in 1993, that 6% of males in the 11th grade had at least once brought a handgun to school (O'Donnel 772). More than 1 in 20 had brought a handgun to school, in other words it was quite a common practice among youths. How does that effect the rest of us? Parents might just get the news from police officers that their son or daughter had become victim to a stray bullet while attending history class. \n",
            "The lawmakers in the United States are addressing the problem by putting up metal detectors in schools. In the case of metal detectors, officials have realized that preventing the possession of firearms inside the boundary of the school is necessary for the safety of the students and teachers. This is a temporary solution to ever-growing problem. The risk of a student or a teacher getting shot inside the school property has probably been reduced, which is positive. But the fact remains that outside of the school property the risk of being a victimized is growing every year. \n",

Even though there are some who would like to see the NRA and those in its tradition killed, I do not see the point in achieving that result.  The lack of focus on the issue by a significant portion of the American public, combined with the amount of violence in society, strongly suggests that something needs to be done.  Plan B is to create a national standard on buying guns, a move which would rid the country of illegal firearms and help restore peace to society yet again. \n",
            "The Rise of the Gun Control Debate in the United States focuses on one issue and that is the gun laws in the United States.  There is also a great deal we can learn from the debate.  The opponents of gun control bring up their concerns about the costs and benefits of gun control, and I do not dispute that point, but I do not see the point in learning from the opponent's perspective.  The other day during a debate on Gun Control, Senator Markey (D-MA) asked former Vice President Al Gore, who is also an avid gun control user, \"Do you ever wonder if the laws you're trying to enact are important enough that it would be better to ban guns or not?\"  Nye replied, \"No, I don't.\"  Then, in referencing the shooting in Tasmania, Australia, which killed 28 people, he said, \"I do.\"  That answer shows an understanding of the cost and benefit of gun control.  The amount of gun related violence in the U.S., and the toll that it takes on families, communities and the nation as a whole, speaks volumes about the need for gun control. \n",
            "The Lack of an Effective Gun Control System in the United States is Due in Large Part to the Gun Laws of the 19th Century.  Along with extremely strict gun laws in the United States, the lower courts also had close calls with the issue.  In one case the case was decided, the decision was made not to give the accused a day in jail or a year in prison, but for a conviction, there had to be one.  The decision has consequences beyond the prison term, often resulting in harsher sentences for the same offense.  For example, if convicted of a felony, a person is barred from buying, possessing or buying guns for a year.  In one case the United States Supreme Court made the decision to not review cases involving harsher sentences, meaning that cases are decided without any reference to the issue.  Cases like these show why legislation is needed on the issue, and why gun control is so important. \n",

            "Gun control`s impetus in the form of the M1 Garand. Developed by the US military during the Second World War, the M1 Garand was one of the most powerful rifles in the world. It is said that if the gun jammed, it would be like the Japanese dropping their atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The gun featured an ammunition magazine that held up to 10 rounds of ammunition and a detachable box magazine that held up to 15 rounds of ammunition. It was also able to accept 9x19mm ammunition. The most famous shoot-out in US history was the gun control debate of the 1930`s. While the Democrats advocated stricter gun laws, the Republicans opposed further gun control legislation. Instead, they advocated strict gun laws that would prevent future face-offs. During the 1930 presidential campaign, candidate Roosevelt stated: \"There should be no doubt as to the propriety of imposing heavy taxes on the possession of arms.\" [Emphasis added.] This would have no basis in fact; the highest state and federal taxes on the purchase and possession of guns. [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added.] While both the Democrats and Republicans opposed the new laws, the Republicans called for a repeal of the present laws. [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] During the 1930 presidential campaign, Republican candidate Noah Webster, in support of Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, stated: \"The Spanish-American War was the most important foreign policy blunder of the 20th century.\" [Emphasis added.] This is simply not true; the Republicans opposed the War because they saw it as a costly one, and because it involved the use of American blood and treasure. [Emphasis added.] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] During the 1930 presidential campaign, Republican candidate Adlai Stevenson stated: \"The Republicans have never been for peace, and never will be.\" [Emphasis added.] This is simply not true; the Republicans supported the War because it was necessary, and in some cases even voted for it. [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] [Emphasis added!] During the 1948 presidential election, candidate Fred Korematsu, in response to a question from a Senator, stated: “Will the Republicans ever abandon their cherished constitutional right to form a militia and protect themselves, or will they never learn” (Manchurian President, Harry Truman).”Manchurian President Truman added: \"The long shot seems to be winning.\" (Truman).”The long shot seems to be winning, but I still stand firm with the Constitution.\" (Manchurian).”The long shot seems to be winning, but I still stand firm with the Constitution.\" (Manchurian).”The long shot seems to be winning, but I still stand firm with the Constitution.\" (Manchurian). No matter what the outcome, the need for armed citizens is never going to go away. The founding fathers could presumably never imagine the horrendous outcome of their actions. Every year too many lives are claimed as the result of the American government's inability to fully face up to effects of the issue. Compared to other western countries that have considerably stricter gun control laws America is still viewed as \"The Wild-Wild West\". \n",

Stripping away the constitutional right to bear arms might have the effect that only criminals will have access to guns. It is important to understand that in a society where both criminals and law abiding citizens have access to guns thelikelihood of an innocent person getting shot, when both parties are waving guns, is probably greater than if only criminals have guns. A ban on firearms might not be appealing as a short-term solution but it is important that people aren't misled by scare tactics. \n",

IT PROVIDED THAT THE DELEGATION OF THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICERS IN THE COUNTRY, THE MOST VALUABLE PERSONALITY, BE MADE UP OF ONLY THE WORST AMERICAN QUOTES. IT WAS SUPREME THAT IT WAS, AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX.\n",
            "The lack of clarity and ambiguity of the Second Amendment are much of the reason for the gun-control debate.  If the Amendment were more clear one way or the other, “guns are for militias only,” or “guns are for the individuals,” laws and regulations would be much easier to make.  However, this is not the case, but it could be soon enough.  One case making its way through the federal court system involves a man who was arrested for possessing a gun while under a restraining order.  The judge in the case threw out the charge because he said it violated the man’s Second Amendment right (Cannon 24).  The case is major because it has the potential to make it to the Supreme Court, and if it does it will force the court to rule one way or the other.  If they uphold the decision, giving the individual the right to bear arms, as one law professor writes, “the hands of the American people would be tied up in regulating arms” (24).  If the decision is overturned, the courts will “define the limit of the law” (24).  The result is an answer to who has the right to bear arms.  \n",
            "In addition to giving a look at the role courts can and do play in politics, the gun control debate shows some of the effects of interest groups on American politics.  The whole gun control debate is for the most part brought to the government by pro gun control interest groups, and then heavily opposed by its opponents.  Interest groups from both sides fundraise and support candidates that will propose and support bills and policies that agree with their interests.  In this way the gun control debate can have an effect on who is currently in office, whether it be Congress or the President, and who is in office is key as to whether proposals make it anywhere or not.  Interest groups have kept the issue of gun control in legislation for many years because they lobby candidates and the issue goes back on forth, but makes no real significant progress either way. Money plays a role in debate because of its effect on the ability to lobby candidates.  Much of the NRA’s success in defeating or “watering down” gun control bills is due to the amount of money they spend on supporting candidates to get them in office, and lobbying congressmen already there.  \n",

Many experts suggest that countries with stricter gun laws should at least partially offset the economic costs of fighting and storing large numbers of guns. Countries such as the UK and US have indicated that they are unlikely to change their gun laws any time soon. International comparisons are quickly becoming meaningless because of the speed with which guns are changing hands. It is important to understand that in a society that values guns more than all other criteria, laws that punish those who knowingly and intentionally endanger the safety of society are justified. A prohibition on firearms is never justified, and those who make such a claim are sadly mistaken. The risk of a violent individual obtaining a firearm should not be used as justification for breaking the law.\n",

            "The need for a national standard on the possession and distribution of firearms is considerable. The lack of such a standard may be one reason for the increasingly frequent gun control disputes in the US. The other reason may be that the lack of a clear-cut line between the legal and illegal branches of the same instrumentality, the need for a national standard on this issue is obvious.\n",
            "A national standard on the possession and distribution of firearms is strongly opposed by the NRA, the Gun Owners of America, the Gun Policy Alliance, and the pro-gun control Liberty Counsel.

            "Their argument is that if guns are illegal in one country, then they must also be illegal in that country”s neighboring countries. This is a weak argument in my view; the scoring system used in scoring the two countries is much more important than the legitimacy of the argument.\n",
            "The extent to which the two governments agree with the NRA is often questioned, and whether or not they do, is beside the point.

The decision paved the way for the “open carry of firearms without a license required by the law” (\"Maguire 58\").  This decision has many contemporary scholars arguing that the decision gives the “freedom of bearing arms for lawful purposes,” meaning that “anyone can have access to a gun if he or she wants to,” meaning that individuals can no longer be held responsible for the actions of others.  There are also many who feel that the decision is a misuse of the court's time and energy, and that the courts have become politicized.  In any event, the decision has immediate effects, meaning that people who are intent on exercising their Constitutional right to bear arms will find a way.

In fact, kids between the ages 16 and 19 have the highest handgun victimization rate among all age groups (O’Donnel 771). It should come as no surprise then that kids are usually the first to know about a gunfight (Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, et al.).  Along with guns, other weapons kids will use to further their criminal activities.  Along with guns, there are lots of other weapons kids will probably not only use for illegal activities but they might even become involved in.  As one analyst from the Violence Policy Center said, “The more accessibility to guns, the higher the rates of gun-related death and injury” (73).  This seems to be the truth; the chances of a kid becoming infatuated with a gun as a means of protection are probably greater than if the gun were kept within the family.   hydration plays a role in keeping kids safe, so don’t limit your kids options to bring guns home from the gun show or to rent a gun online.  Instead, think of gun control as a way for you and me to protect our children’s health and safety.  \n",

According to a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association,“a firearm in the home is most likely to be used for suicide or a murder, and a handgun to be used for self-defense” (Maguire 30).  The extent to which guns are used as they were meant to be as stated in the Constitution, is far outweighed by the extent to which they are used for violent acts.  Rather than providing reason for the right to bear arms, this apparent misuse of guns provides more then enough reason for gun control.  Calling for gun control is not a solution to the problem, but it is a start. \n",

            "The survey conducted by the American Psychological Association,“a firearm in the home is most likely to be used for suicide or a murder, and a handgun to be used for self-defense”, provides the most accurate estimates of the true extent to which guns are used as they were meant to be.  However, due to the small sample size, accurate figures are often disputed.  For example, statistics have shown, incorrectly, that 83% of Americans believe that having guns is necessary for protection, and 6% do not even realize that statistic).  Further, statistics have shown, incorrectly, that having guns is associated with higher levels of physical safety, lower levels of emotional safety, and higher levels of achievement (O’Donnell 771).  Ultimately, the decision whether to arm yourself or not is up to each person, and each person should make up their own mind. \n",
            "The lack of clarity and ambiguity of the Second Amendment are much of the reason for the gun-control debate.  If the Amendment were more clear one way or the other, “guns are for militias only,” or “guns are for the individuals,” laws and regulations would be much easier to make.  However, this is not the case, but it could be soon enough.  One case making its way through the federal court system involves a man who was arrested for possessing a gun while under a restraining order.  The judge in the case threw out the charge because he said it violated the man’s Second Amendment right (Cannon 24).  The case is major because it has the potential to make it to the Supreme Court, and if it does it will force the court to rule one way or the other.
